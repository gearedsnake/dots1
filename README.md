# Installation guide
GTK theme: copy theme from dots/.themes/mountain to ~/.themes/

XFWM theme: already bundled with the gtk theme, just enable it in the window manager settings or turn on the "set matching xfwm4 theme if there is one" switch

TINT2 theme: copy tint2rc from dots/.config/tint2/tint2rc to ~/.config/tint2/ also if you want to replace the xfce4-panel with tint2 panel without deleting it, you can use panel.sh script. Remember that you need to give it permissions to execute first!

GTK.CSS: i made some tweaks to the xfce4-notifyd, to apply them just copy dots/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css

# Notes & Credits
xfwm theme is a modified version of addy's 2bxfwm theme, [repo with the original theme](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-theme-collections)

GTK theme is made using themix
